# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

title: Machine Learning. Simplified.

  I learned machine learning through random blog posts, pytorch discussion forums,
  and the occasional youtube lecture. It took hundreds of hours to put the pieces together,
  making me realize that there is no easy way to learn machine learning. Yes, there are
  dozens of courses, but they're not meant for someone who just wants to learn how to code
  the algorithms in a week. This site will teach you everything you need to know about machine
  learning as simply and as fast as possible.
